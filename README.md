# Clustering-and-Analysis-of-Movie-Review

## Overview

This is for 2020 Data Creater Camp:Preliminary Round, hosted by NIA(National Information Society Agency). We have to grasp movie audience's tendency by analyzing "Movie Review". First, to gauge sincerity, we make clusters by length of the review. Then, we derive the keyword features from each clusters and visualize by word cloud chart.

## Process

### 1. Preprocessing

- with length of reviews (short vs. long)
- tokenizer
  - Okt
  - Komoran
  - Kkma
  - Mecab

### 2. Clustering

### 3. Analysis

### 4. Visualizing

- with Word Cloud

## Dataset

- [Naver sentiment movie corpus(NSMC)](https://github.com/e9t/nsmc)
- 200,000 Naver movie review data
- Positive review : over grade 9/10
- Negative review : lower grade 4/10
- grade 5~8 reviews removed
